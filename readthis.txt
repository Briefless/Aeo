I made this for a discord server that offered paid services like 9 months ago and yeah ok mind the poorly formatted code but it works havent tested.

What the output means:
the two numbers you see are the perm level handler

first number is your level
second is the level needed!

the wl/bl/unbl requests are self explanatory

and stuff like BLS, N, Y and AEO_WHATEVERTHEFUCK are just returns from the server that it prints out for debug purposes!
